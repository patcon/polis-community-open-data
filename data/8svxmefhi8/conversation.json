    "topic": "How should we bring new people into Solarpunk?",
    "description": "Solarpunk has two primary tenants. The first is that we envision an ideal future, imagining a world with a stable climate, social justice, local communities, diversity and inclusion of everyone, responsible technology use, etc. This tenant is primarily embodied in our art, fiction, music, and other imaginations of what that future could be like. The second is the recognition that we have yet to achieve that future, and is centered on activism and political movement, coalition building, decolonialisation, and all of the other steps necessary to achieve the vision we've imagined together. How can we bring more people into this movement?",
