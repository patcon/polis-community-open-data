    "topic": "BRIGADE IMPACT: What CHANGE does your brigade want to create? Where is your brigade ALREADY successful?",
    "description": "As a network, we want to deepen our understanding of what DRIVES your brigade. What have those motivations allowed you to accomplish? For more info on this larger effort, check out this post on the [C4A Discourse](https://discourse.codeforamerica.org/t/september-30-september-workshop-theory-of-change/897/3).\n\nThis pol.is is one input to a 3 month conversation that will progress through [Brigade Congress](https://www.codeforamerica.org/events/brigade-congress-2020) and then through the end of the year. Our hope is that **every single volunteer** has a chance to weigh in before (or during Brigade Congress). Please spread the word!\n\n*Note for non-brigade affiliated volunteers: YOU ARE WELCOME HERE! Feel free to use \"pass/unsure\" if you feel a question does not apply to you.*\n\nTips:\n\nAvoid multi-part statements or statements that use the word \"and\"\n\nUse these prefixes for adding statements\n\n- **\"MY BRIGADE\u2026\"** (to express things your brigade currently does)\n\n- **\"I WANT MY BRIGADE TO\u2026\"** (to express desires or goals YOU have for your local brigade)\n\n- **\"MY BRIGADE HAS SAID\u2026\"** (to express desires or goals you have heard expressed by other volunteers in your local brigade)\n\n- **\"I BELIEVE\u2026\"** (to express relevant beliefs about brigades and civic tech work)\n\n- **\u201cOUR COMMUNITY NEEDS A BRIGADE BECAUSE\u2026\u201d** (to express the value of a current or proposed brigade to your community)",
