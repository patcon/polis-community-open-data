    "topic": "Low Speed Streets in Pasig",
    "description": "The traffic code of the Philippines limits speeds in city and municipal streets to 30 kmph. According to the World Health Organization, low speed streets save lives, improve health and support efforts to shift to zero-carbon mobility. Low speed streets ensure that streets are safe for the most vulnerable \u2013 pedestrians, cyclists, children, senior citizens and people with disabilities. It supports health because when streets are safe, people walk and cycle more. It is green because when cycling and walking is promoted, car dependency and harmful vehicle emissions are reduced.\n\nPasig city is championing the move to enforce 30 kmph in their urban centers. What do you think about this initiative? \n",
