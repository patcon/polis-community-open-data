    "topic": "Town of Salem Master Plan Visioning Survey",
    "description": "We\u2019re eager to hear your opinions and ideas on Salem! Topics include economic vibrancy, land use, housing, transportation, open space and recreation, natural and cultural resources, and town services and facilities. Your responses to this survey will help define the focus and key goals for the Master Plan Update.\n\nRead and vote on the existing statements.\nFor each statement, click Agree, Disagree, or Pass. You might decide to pass, for example, because a statement is vague or confusing, or it does not apply to you. You do not need to answer every question. Even answering ten questions contributes to the data. You can also come back at another time to answer more questions.\n\nAdd your own statement! Click in the field below the conversation (\"share perspective\"), type your statement, and click Submit. A good statement is a concise, stand-alone idea that raises a new perspective. Statements relevant to the topics covered by the Master Plan will be considered for inclusion in the survey. Statements that are derogatory, irrelevant to the plan, or attack individuals or groups will not be added.\n",
