# Polis: Crowdsourced Open Data

This is a collection of crowd-sourced open data from Polis conversations found over the years.

This repo currently only contains data from conversations that have been closed to new votes. This is in the interest of not making open conversations overly discoverable.

## Roadmap

- [x] Update CSV from Google Sheet daily
- [x] Update datasets from Polis API weekly
- [ ] Check lastvote and skip if nothing newer
- [ ] Summarize conversation topics in README
- [ ] Figure out better way to write export content as CSV instead of JSON
- [ ] Document usage with `polis-community/red-dwarf`
- [ ] Figure out a way to strip conversation IDs to publish conversations still open
